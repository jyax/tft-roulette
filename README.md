# TFT Strats
**Strategy Generation for Riot Games Teamfight Tactics**
I am developing a site that presents strategies for players of the game Teamfight Tactics. My initial pursuit for this project is to enhance player engagement through diversified and sometimes randomized generated strategies.

## Current Stage of Development is Prototyping of strategy generation
All data is currently provided through a few endpoints, CDragon, Riot's DDragon, as well as future usage of Riot's REST API.

It is no more that a personal passion project for the game I love, however I do see future implementation options where upon establishing a well divised strategy generator, I would like to implement some of the following...

## Future Implementation Plans
- Visual Team Planner
- Player Statistics & Match Analysis
- Tiers of Strategy Generation [Randomized, Stats-Based Generation, and a Personalized Stats-Based Generation]
- Dynamic Updating to allow for new metas and new mechanics to be implemented and dynamically utilize the information for strategies
